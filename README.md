# Better-Data-Viewer
This is the second iteration of a telemetry viewer headed by Kai, Travis, Ariel and Gavin

## Philosphy
The construction behind this application is meant to make use of the OPEN/CLOSE principle, as well as the other SOLID design choices.

This will create a modular view, ready to have different items added on

## Approach
See `UML.drawio` for the diagram
